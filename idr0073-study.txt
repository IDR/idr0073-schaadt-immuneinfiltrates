Study Type	histology

Study Description	Object-oriented image analysis and graph-based description of the spatial context of B- und T-lymphocytes were performed to reflect the degree of organization in lymphocyte accumulations and their similarity with TLOs.  This study addresses the need to detect and reproducibly classify immune cell infiltrates in histopathological sections. We propose complementing observer-dependent approaches of immune cell evaluation in microscopy images with reproducible measures for spatial composition of lymphocytic infiltrates.

Experiment Number	1									
Comment[IDR Experiment Name]	idr0073-schaadt-immuneinfiltrates/experimentA	
Experiment Sample Type	tissue								
Experiment Description	Based on cell coordinates detected in the full image, a Delaunay triangulation and distance criteria were used to build neighborhood graphs. The composition of nodes and edges are used for classification, e.g. using a support vector machine.
